# Hikari extensions (`.hiki`)

A Hikari extension is a small dexed JAR implementing Hikari's own provider API
(`com.hikari.ext.HikariProvider`). It plugs into Home, search, detail and the
player exactly like a Stremio addon or a CloudStream `.cs3` plugin — but it is
written against Hikari's SDK, so the fixes are made **in the SDK once** and
every extension benefits, instead of fighting CloudStream's desktop assumptions
(no-op WebView resolver, missing context, plugin-specific Cloudflare hacks).

The SDK classes live in the Hikari APK (`com.hikari.ext`), so:

- the app resolves them at runtime — extensions only need to be **dexed**, not
  bundled with the API;
- extensions can use the same platform libraries the app uses: `org.json`,
  `org.jsoup`, and all of `HikariNet`.

## The API in one screen

```kotlin
interface HikariProvider {
    val id: String                  // stable slug, e.g. "yts"
    val name: String
    val mainUrl: String
    val description: String get() = ""
    val version: Int get() = 1
    val iconUrl: String? get() = null
    val tvTypes: Set<HikariMediaType> get() = setOf(MOVIE, SERIES)

    fun catalogs(): List<HikariCatalog> = emptyList()
    suspend fun getCatalog(catalog: HikariCatalog, page: Int): List<HikariMedia> = emptyList()
    suspend fun search(query: String, page: Int): List<HikariMedia> = emptyList()
    suspend fun getMeta(media: HikariMedia): HikariMedia = media
    suspend fun getEpisodes(media: HikariMedia): List<HikariEpisode>? = null
    suspend fun getStreams(media: HikariMedia, episode: HikariEpisode?): List<HikariStream>  // required
}
```

A minimal extension implements `search` + `getStreams` (or `catalogs` +
`getCatalog` for a catalog-only source). Everything else has a safe default.

**`page` is 1-based.** The first page is `1`, and every caller passes `1` (the
catalog pager starts at 1, `skip` is computed as `(page - 1) * 100`). An
extension that has no real pagination should return its content for `page <= 1`
and an empty list for anything higher — guarding on `page > 0` makes the
provider look permanently empty (this exact off-by-one made every installed
SkyStream extension report "Couldn't load …" on Home and answer every search in
5ms with "no matching title").

## Extensions behind a verification wall are skipped silently

If an extension answers with a browser-verification wall (its own error text is
a challenge page, or its declared site is a host that already answered a
challenge we could not pass), Hikari does **not** search it again for the rest
of the session: no search slot, no cold plugin load, no entry in the server
chooser's progress line, and no message about the block anywhere in the UI. The
record expires after 10 minutes, so an extension becomes askable again on its
own. The globe (WebView) button still opens the extension's own site if the user
wants to look.

## The SDK helpers (`HikariNet`)

```kotlin
HikariNet.getString(url, headers)                       // body text (null on failure)
HikariNet.getJson(url, headers)                         // org.json JSONObject?
HikariNet.getBytes(url, headers)                        // ByteArray?
HikariNet.fetch(url, headers)                           // status + url + body
HikariNet.browserHeaders                                // desktop Chrome fingerprint

// The StreamHG/hgcloud-style helper: runs a page in a real Android WebView and
// returns every request whose URL matched the capture regex (e.g. the m3u8 the
// player JS fires), with its headers:
val hits = HikariNet.resolveWithWebView(embedUrl, Regex("(m3u8|master\\.txt)"))
hits.firstOrNull()?.let { HikariStream("Stream", it.url, headers = it.headers, isM3u8 = true) }
```

All requests go through the app's hardened stack: redirects, generous timeouts,
browser User-Agent, Conscrypt TLS.

## Stream shapes

| Playback mode        | Set on `HikariStream`                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| HLS / direct         | `url` (+ optional `headers`, `isM3u8`/`isMpd`)          |
| Torrent              | `isTorrent = true`, `infoHash`, `trackers` (+ `fileIdx`)|
| YouTube              | `ytId`                                                  |
| External/browser     | `externalUrl = true`, `url`                             |

Torrents are played by the app's built-in TorrServer engine.

## Building an extension

1. Write your provider against `com.hikari.ext` (grab the classes from the
   `app/src/main/java/com/hikari/ext` sources in this repo).
2. Compile and **dex** the jar so Android can load it (a plain `.jar` won't
   load on device):

   ```bash
   # compile against the SDK classes on your classpath
   kotlinc -classpath com.hikari.ext.* -d classes src/... 
   # put classes + manifest.json into a jar
   jar cf MyExtension.jar -C classes . -C manifestdir manifest.json
   # dex the jar
   d8 MyExtension.jar --output .
   # d8 emits classes.dex next to MyExtension.jar — repack into the .hiki
   jar cf MyExtension.hiki MyExtension.jar classes.dex manifest.json
   ```

   (Simplest reliable shape: the `.hiki` is a jar containing `classes.dex`
   plus `manifest.json`.)

3. `manifest.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "My Extension",
     "version": 1,
     "mainClass": "com.example.MyProvider"
   }
   ```

   `mainClass` may be an array if one file ships several providers — each
   becomes a separate installable provider.

4. Install in the app: Extensions → **Install .hiki from URL** or
   **Pick .hiki file**. Failed loads surface the real error on the card.

## Reference implementation

The bundled **YTS** provider (`com.hikari.ext.providers.YtsProvider`) ships in
the APK and is auto-registered on first run. It is a complete, working provider
against a public JSON API (torrents → TorrServer) and the cleanest template for
a new extension.
