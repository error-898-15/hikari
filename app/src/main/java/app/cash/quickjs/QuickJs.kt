/**
 * The JavaScript engine extensions are compiled against, under the name they
 * link to.
 *
 * Aniyomi bundles `app.cash.quickjs` (a fork of Cash App's QuickJS binding), and
 * extensions call it DIRECTLY — AnimeOnline.Ninja's `VrfInterceptor` runs
 * `QuickJs.create().use { it.evaluate("$west + $east") }` to solve that site's
 * `wsidchk` interstitial, and it is the standard tool for the "compute a token
 * the page's own script would have computed" class of anti-bot wall. Hikari
 * ships the same ENGINE (the `com.dokar.quickjs` runtime the Nuvio and SkyStream
 * providers use, see `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.network.JavaScriptEngine`) but not
 * under that package, so an extension reaching for it died with
 * `NoClassDefFoundError: app.cash.quickjs.QuickJs` — and on a site that needs
 * that computation the failure showed up as an HTTP 403 from the challenge page.
 *
 * This class is the thin bridge: same public shape (`create`, `evaluate`,
 * `get`, `set`, `close`), same synchronous behaviour, backed by the engine
 * Hikari already ships — no second native library, no second QuickJS in the APK.
 *
 * The blocking calls are safe here by construction: extensions call this from
 * their own network threads (an OkHttp interceptor or a source's parse method),
 * never from the main thread, and each call runs on the engine's own dispatcher.
