/**
 * Runs NuvioMobile-style JS providers inside a fresh embedded QuickJS engine
 * per call — exactly how the real NuvioMobile app runs plugins (com.nuvio.app
 * PluginRuntime: one `QuickJs.create` per provider call, plain HTTP through a
 * synchronous fetch bridge, no WebView, no Cloudflare verification).
 *
 * Each provider is a plain CommonJS module exporting
 * `getStreams(tmdbId, mediaType, season, episode)` (plus an optional
 * `onSettings()`), following the official NuvioMobile plugin conventions. The
 * engine only ever executes the provider code — every network request goes
 * through the ASYNCHRONOUS `__hikariFetch` bridge (OkHttp, see
 * [bridgeFetchAsync]), so the JS runtime needs no WebView and no network
 * capability of its own, and a provider whose own code fires several requests
 * at once (which is how the big all-in-one providers are fast at all) gets
 * them all in flight together instead of one after another. The shared runtime
 * (assets/nuvio/boot.js polyfills + assets/nuvio/cheerio.js + assets/nuvio/
 * harness.js) is evaluated into the engine before each provider runs, so no
 * state ever leaks between providers and a hung/crashing provider can only
 * kill its own fresh engine.
 *
 * Compared with the previous WebView pool this removes:
 *   - the WebView pool (PooledWebView/Waiter/acquire/release/recycle) — the
 *     whole engine is torn down per call, so no shared state can wedge,
 *   - CloudflareVerifier interception — nuvio itself does no CF solving, it
 *     just hands the provider whatever HTTP returns, so neither do we,
 *   - the main-thread hop — everything runs on Dispatchers.Default.
