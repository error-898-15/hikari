/**
 * The one place the app decides whether adult material may be shown.
 *
 * **What the switch means.** Settings → Content → NSFW. ON (the default) is the
 * app exactly as it has always been: every installed extension is listed and every
 * title a provider returns is shown. OFF, the app stops being a way to run into
 * that material at all: extensions whose own metadata is tagged 18+ (Tachiyomi's
 * `tachiyomi.extension.nsfw` / `tachiyomi.animeextension.nsfw`, and CloudStream's
 * `CONTENT_WARNING_NSFW`) disappear from every list the user picks from, and
 * titles that are themselves adult are filtered out of every catalogue, shelf,
 * search result and grid before they are drawn — including the ones the user
 * already has in Library or History.
 *
 * **Why the filter runs at DRAW time instead of in the stores.** A title can carry
 * its adult marker in any of half a dozen places (the provider's own response, a
 * TMDB `adult` flag, a genre tag, the name itself), and those places disagree. The
 * one thing every screen has in common is the moment it turns a list of items into
 * cards — so the gate is applied there, as the last step before drawing. That also
 * makes the switch instant and complete: nothing has to be re-fetched or
 * re-cached, and no screen can "remember" a row of adult titles from before the
 * switch was flipped (a stale cache is exactly how a filtered app still shows the
 * thing the user asked it not to).
 *
 * **What counts as adult.** Deliberately specific, because an over-eager rule
 * silently deletes a library:
 *
 *  * an explicit marker from the source — TMDB's `adult`, or a provider whose own
 *    type/metadata says so ([MediaItem.nsfw]);
 *  * an 18+/adult GENRE or tag (see [ADULT_WORDS]) — how manga and extension
 *    catalogues actually mark this material;
 *  * an 18+/adults-only age rating where the app knows one (see [ADULT_RATINGS]).
 *
 * The user named "adult R-rated" as what they want hidden, so the film certificates
 * the trade calls adults-only are in the rating set — `R`, `NC-17`, `X`, `18`,
 * `R18+` and their spellings. It is intentionally NOT "anything a rating body
 * called unsuitable for children": TV-MA is the television equivalent of an R and
 * covers most prestige drama, and hiding every TV-MA show would empty the shelves
 * of someone who only meant to turn off adult material.
 *
 * This object holds the flag as a plain field that the UI reads synchronously
 * (drawing cannot wait for a Flow), kept in step with the stored preference by a
 * single collect launched from the app's own start-up in [com.hikari.app.HikariApp]
 * — the same shape the other app-wide caches use.
