/**
 * How wide a lookup is allowed to search — Settings → Playback → Server search.
 *
 * [allExtensions] is the app's long-standing behaviour and the default: a title
 * is searched across every installed extension at once, so whichever repo has a
 * working server wins, and the player's "Select server" list gathers what all of
 * them found.
 *
 * Off, a lookup is confined to the ONE extension the title was opened from —
 * the CloudStream model, where a film plays from the repo you picked and its own
 * hosts, and nothing else is contacted: no cross-extension search, no background
 * sweep, no episode list borrowed from another site. For someone who installed a
 * hundred extensions and wants a title to play from the one they chose (and not
 * spend a minute asking the other ninety-nine), that is the honest switch.
 *
 * A process-wide flag rather than a parameter because the pass, the sweep, the
 * episode fallback and the player's status line all have to agree on it within
 * one lookup, and only the store knows the user's choice. Mirrored from the
 * store at startup and on every change (see HikariApp), so the search never has
 * to await DataStore mid-pass.
 *
 * [exceptions] is the third state between those two, for the person who wants
 * "only this extension" almost all of the time but one or two repos always
 * asked. It holds the ids of the extensions picked as exceptions (empty when the
 * switch is off), and the rule is:
 *
 *  - a title opened anywhere ELSE is searched through its own extension AND the
 *    exception extensions, even though [allExtensions] is off. So playing a film
 *    from 1Shows also asks the two repos the user marked, and their servers
 *    appear in the same list;
 *  - a title opened FROM an exception extension plays from THAT extension alone,
 *    even though it is an exception. This is the point of marking it: the repo
 *    keeps its own catalogue to itself and is never mixed into a search started
 *    inside it.

     * Is [candidate] confidently the SAME title as [wanted]?
     *
     * [titleScore] answers "how similar are these two strings", which is the
     * right question for ORDERING a repo's own fuzzy search page but the wrong
     * one for deciding that a repo's entry IS the title the user asked to play.
     * A token-overlap score could clear [CROSS_EXT_MIN_MATCH] between two
     * completely different shows that happen to share a word ("Renegade
     * Immortal" vs "Immortal Samsara", a donghua vs a 2024 Indian serial), and
     * the player then started a different film off that repo — the reported "I
     * asked for Renegade Immortal episode 148 and it played some Bollywood
     * movie from a different server".
     *
     * The rule here is deliberately strict and structural:
     *  - when the two entries are known to be different media KINDS (a MOVIE
     *    entry while an episode of a SERIES is being played), reject — a film
     *    does not have an episode 148;
     *  - one title's significant words must CONTAIN the other's, so "renegade
     *    immortal" matches "Renegade Immortal (Xian Ni)" and "Renegade Immortal
     *    Season 1", but never "Immortal Samsara";
     *  - the FIRST significant word of one title must appear in the other, so
     *    "One Piece" cannot match "Piece of Cake";
     *  - when both years are known and differ by more than one, only an exact
     *    normalised match is accepted (a remake sharing a title is not the same
     *    show).
     *
     * Over-strict is the intended direction: a repo that is wrongly rejected
     * only costs one missing server, while a repo wrongly accepted plays the
     * wrong video — which is what the user reported and asked to be prevented.
     * Only the cross-extension pass consults this; the ORIGIN provider's own
     * search results are never filtered by it.
