/**
 * Aggregate review scores for one title — the row of coloured IMDb /
 * Rotten Tomatoes / Metacritic / Letterboxd / TMDB badges under the Play
 * button, the way the reference clients show them.
 *
 * None of these sources needs an API key, and each one is independently
 * optional: a source that is blocked, slow, renamed or simply has no entry for
 * the title contributes nothing and the row renders the rest. That is the whole
 * design constraint here — a review site is decoration, so it must never be able
 * to delay or break the page it decorates.
 *
 *  1. **IMDb** — tried in order: OMDb (current numbers, one decimal, plus the
 *     vote count), Wikidata (`P444`/`P447` keyed by the IMDb id — the broadest
 *     coverage, but user-maintained and often stale), then the Cinemeta mirror
 *     Stremio uses. imdb.com itself answers a plain HTTP client with an empty
 *     body and IMDb's own GraphQL endpoint is Cloudflare-guarded, so a mirror is
 *     the only way to get a number at all; three of them make it reliable.
 *     When nothing knows the `tt` id, IMDb's own keyless suggestion endpoint
 *     resolves one from the title and year, and Cinemeta's search index is the
 *     fallback for a network where that host is blocked.
 *  2. **Rotten Tomatoes** `/{m|tv}/{slug}` — the page's `media-scorecard-json`
 *     carries the tomatometer AND the popcornmeter, each with its review count,
 *     average and sentiment: two badges from one request.
 *  3. **Metacritic** `/{movie|tv}/{slug}/` — the JSON-LD `aggregateRating`.
 *  4. **Letterboxd** `/imdb/{ttid}/` — `twitter:data2` ("4.46 out of 5").
 *  5. **TMDB** — the score the detail page's own details lookup already
 *     fetched, so the strip always has at least one badge.
 *
 * Results are cached on disk for a day (a review score does not move that
 * fast), which also keeps the request count to the sites at one per title —
 * the slug guesses below are cheap but they are still network round-trips.
