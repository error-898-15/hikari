/**
 * The best video quality Hikari KNOWS a title comes in, so a poster can badge it
 * (see [com.hikari.app.ui.PosterStyle.showQuality]).
 *
 * The app is a client for other people's sites: it has no quality metadata of
 * its own, and inventing one would put a lie on the poster. So the label is only
 * ever read from something the app really saw, cheapest source first:
 *
 *  1. the item's own text — extension and repo rows routinely name a title
 *     "Movie (2024) 1080p WEB-DL", which is the site's own answer;
 *  2. the SERVERS found the last time the title was opened ([remember] — the
 *     player and the detail page hand every completed source search over), whose
 *     names carry the quality the sites serve ("HdHub 4K", "NetMirror 720p").
 *
 * A title whose quality the app has never seen gets NO badge — the badge is
 * opt-in (Settings → Poster styling → Quality badge, off by default) precisely
 * because it cannot appear everywhere.
 *
 * Storage mirrors [Ratings]: one small JSON map in the app's files dir, loaded
 * once on first read and saved on every improvement. [revision] is bumped when a
 * new label lands so the poster cells showing that title repaint.
