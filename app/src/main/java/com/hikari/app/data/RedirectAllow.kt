/**
 * Synchronous mirror of the "Allowed redirect links" list (Settings → Privacy &
 * Browsing → WebView safety), plus the matcher every redirect decision uses.
 *
 * WHY this exists: the real list lives in DataStore, i.e. it is only readable
 * from a coroutine, and two things need it BEFORE a coroutine can answer —
 *
 *  1. a WebView that is already loading. The order of a page's own redirects is
 *     not ours to choose: the allow list used to be read from the store inside
 *     the WebView's own `lifecycleScope.launch`, so a redirect that arrived in
 *     the first few hundred milliseconds was judged against an EMPTY set and
 *     blocked. That is the reported "I added net77.cc to the allowed redirect
 *     links and the verification WebView still says Blocked redirect to
 *     net77.cc".
 *  2. the Cloudflare-verification view, which refuses every main-frame
 *     navigation that is not the site it started on (see
 *     WebViewActivity.isVerifyAllowed). An extension whose own site redirects to
 *     a mirror host is exactly the case the allow list exists for, so the list
 *     has to be part of that decision too — and it has to be there instantly.
 *
 * Written by [AppStore] on every read and write, so a link the user adds in
 * Settings takes effect for the very next redirect: no restart, no waiting for
 * a store round-trip.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF ENTRY, one rule each (see [allowsIn]):
 *
 *  * a HOST — "net77.cc", "player.example.com" — matches that host itself and
 *    every subdomain of it. The precise form, for a site the user knows by
 *    name;
 *  * a WORD — "filester" — has no dot in it and matches ANY link that contains
 *    it, whatever sits behind it: filester.com, filester.me, filester.gg,
 *    filester.sh, an-filester-mirror.xyz. This is the form that actually keeps
 *    working for an extension's file host, whose TLD rotates every few weeks —
 *    the reported "I keep adding the new domain and it blocks the next one".
 *    A word is compared against the WHOLE url, case-insensitively, so a link
 *    that carries the host in a query parameter counts as well.
