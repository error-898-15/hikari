/**
 * Bounds and de-serialises the heavy "load a plugin archive" work.
 *
 * Hikari ships two plugin runtimes — CloudStream `.cs3` dex archives
 * ([com.hikari.app.cs3.Cs3PluginManager]) and Hikari `.hiki` archives
 * ([com.hikari.app.hiki.HikariPluginManager]) — and each used to guard itself
 * with ONE global lock (a `ReentrantLock`, and `@Synchronized` respectively).
 * On a device with a few hundred installed extensions that meant every archive
 * loaded strictly one at a time: a cold Home, a cross-extension search and an
 * install all queued behind whichever load happened to be running, and a single
 * plugin that does network work in `load()` could hold the queue for its whole
 * 45-second budget. That is what left Home showing "none found / still
 * searching" with 240 extensions installed.
 *
 * This object replaces both guards with three properties:
 *
 *  - [lockFor] hands out a lock PER PLUGIN PATH, so different plugins load
 *    concurrently while the same plugin is never loaded twice at once (and a
 *    re-entrant call from inside a plugin's own `load()` is the only case that
 *    can see its own path busy);
 *  - [withSlot] caps how many archives the process dex-loads at the same time.
 *    Each `PathClassLoader` commit costs memory the GC cannot reclaim until the
 *    load settles, so "one thread per extension, all 240 at once" OOMs on weak
 *    devices;
 *  - both are RE-ENTRANT PER THREAD: a plugin whose `load()` ends up asking for
 *    another plugin must not deadlock against a slot it already holds.
