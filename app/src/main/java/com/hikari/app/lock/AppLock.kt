/**
 * The app lock's password storage (Settings → Privacy & Browsing → App lock).
 *
 * The password is never written anywhere: what is stored is a PBKDF2
 * derivation of it plus a random 16-byte salt, as `algo:salt:hash`, all hex.
 *
 *  * `algo` is recorded so an install that was locked on an older phone still
 *    verifies after the derivation changes: `sha256` is used where the platform
 *    has it (API 26+, i.e. everything current) and `sha1` where it does not —
 *    Android only added PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 in API 26, and this app runs on
 *    API 24. A lock that silently stops accepting the right password on an old
 *    device would be worse than one built on the older primitive.
 *  * A blob with NO algorithm — `salt:hash`, the shape written before the
 *    algorithm was recorded — is still accepted ([parse] takes both), and with
 *    no algorithm recorded BOTH primitives are tried. That is a lock that was
 *    set by an older build: refusing it would lock the user out of their own
 *    app for a reason no one could see.
 *  * The password is tried trimmed and exactly as typed, for the same reason: a
 *    build that did not trim (or a keyboard that appended a space) would
 *    otherwise produce a blob that no trimmed attempt can ever match.
 *  * The comparison is constant-time ([MessageDigest.isEqual]), so a wrong
 *    password cannot be narrowed down by how long the check took.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO recovery: nothing in the app can read the password
 * back, which is the whole point of storing only a derivation. The settings
 * card says so before the password is set, and the unlock screen offers the one
 * honest way out — turning the lock off (see [com.hikari.app.ui.AppLockScreen]).
