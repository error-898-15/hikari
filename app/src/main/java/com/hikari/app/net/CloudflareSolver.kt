/**
 * Clears the Cloudflare challenge in front of ONE URL by loading it in an
 * offscreen WebView — silently, at most once per host.
 *
 * **Why Hikari needs this at all.** An Aniyomi/Mihon extension's HTTP client is
 * [eu.kanade.tachiyomi.network.NetworkHelper]'s, and an extension whose site
 * sits behind Cloudflare has no other way through: the extensions say so
 * themselves. AnimeOnline.Ninja's own source reads
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * override fun popularAnimeRequest(page: Int) = GET("$baseUrl/tendencias/", headers)
 * // …both hosts serve an identical managed challenge on every path,
 * // so keep each request single-hopped and let CloudflareInterceptor solve it
 * ```
 *
 * i.e. it expects the APP's client to clear the challenge — which is exactly
 * what Aniyomi, Tadami and Nekoread do with a hidden WebView. Hikari's own
 * [CloudflareVerifier] only ever *reused* a clearance the user had earned by
 * tapping the globe, so every catalog request from such an extension came back
 * as "Home failed: HTTP error 403" while unprotected extensions in the same
 * repo loaded fine.
 *
 * **How the solve reaches the extension.** The clearance Cloudflare hands the
 * WebView is a `cf_clearance` cookie in the shared WebView cookie jar
 * ([CookieManager]) — the same jar the extension's OkHttp client reads through
 * [eu.kanade.tachiyomi.network.AndroidCookieJar]. So the request the
 * interceptor retries afterwards is served normally, with no extra plumbing.
 *
 * **The User-Agent is not optional.** A `cf_clearance` is minted for the UA the
 * WebView presented and is rejected when the request that follows advertises a
 * different one, so [solve] takes the UA of the pending OkHttp request and makes
 * the WebView use exactly that ([ExtensionCloudflareInterceptor] passes the
 * request's own header).
 *
 * **Nothing opens on the user's screen.** The WebView is never attached to a
 * view, is destroyed as soon as the page settles, and the user's own
 * verification flow (the globe button) stays the fallback: a solve that fails
 * records the host in [CloudflareVerifier], which is what makes the UI offer
 * that deliberate tap.
