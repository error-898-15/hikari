/**
 * The promo guard: the "support us / donate / buy me a coffee" layer.
 *
 * Repos, extensions and the pages they host like to bolt a funding pitch onto
 * their content — a "goal achieved, send extra love, watch an ad to support"
 * card, a Patreon/ko-fi button hung on the side of an extension's settings
 * page, a donation link in a plugin description. Whatever the form, it is the
 * extension talking about MONEY, not about a movie, and Hikari is a place to
 * watch things. So it is dropped everywhere an extension can put it:
 *
 *  - **Pages.** A main-frame navigation to a donation host (or to a
 *    donate/sponsor path on any host) is refused in [com.hikari.app.web.WebViewActivity]
 *    before it loads, and a page that DOES load has its promo blocks hidden by
 *    the injected [com.hikari.app.web.WebViewActivity] promo cleaner — so a
 *    funding card cannot appear inside Hikari even when it rides along with a
 *    real extension page.
 *  - **Text.** Extension-supplied strings (repo and plugin descriptions, the
 *    header/info rows an extension pushes into its own settings screen) are run
 *    through [cleanText], which strips markup and blank-fills anything that is
 *    only a donation pitch, and are dropped outright by [isPromoText].
 *
 * All of this is deliberate and unconditional: it is not a user preference,
 * because there is no version of "show me the extensions' donation dialogs"
 * that belongs in a video app. Nothing about PLAYBACK is touched — a stream URL
 * that happens to contain "donate" is not a page, and [isDonationUrl] is only
 * ever asked about navigations, links and metadata.
