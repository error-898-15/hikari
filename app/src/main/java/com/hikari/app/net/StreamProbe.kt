/**
 * Resolves container-unknown stream URLs (4KHDHub's HubCloud wrapper pages,
 * JSON APIs, HTML players — anything without a real media extension) into the
 * actual playable URL + container type, ONCE, and remembers the answer.
 *
 * Why this lives here and not in the player: the player used to do the whole
 * probe inline on every play, behind a blocking "Preparing stream…" dialog, so
 * every replay of a 4KHDHub title paid the same network round-trip again. This
 * object keeps a process-wide + on-disk cache (so a replayed server starts
 * instantly), shares ONE connection-pooled OkHttp client across every probe
 * (no per-Activity cold TLS handshake), and lets the source search warm the
 * cache in the background while the user is still picking a server.
 *
 * Deliberately plain OkHttp: no Cloudflare verify-WebView interceptor. A probe
 * that needed a WAF clearance could never be reused by ExoPlayer's own
 * OkHttpDataSource anyway, so waiting on it would only add latency (and the
 * "Preparing stream…" stall on servers like 4KHDHub is not a Cloudflare issue).
 * What it DOES do is cloudflare-AWARE skipping: a host already recorded by
 * [CloudflareVerifier] as needing the user's own verification is never probed
 * or warmed, and a challenge the probe meets itself is recorded there (instead
 * of being cached as a dead URL) so the whole app stops waiting on that host —
 * see [resolve], [warm] and [follow].
