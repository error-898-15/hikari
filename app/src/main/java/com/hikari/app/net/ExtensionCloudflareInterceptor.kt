/**
 * Clears Cloudflare (and the JS-interstitial family that behaves like it) for
 * the client EXTENSIONS use — see [CloudflareSolver] for why an extension
 * cannot do this for itself.
 *
 * Placed on [eu.kanade.tachiyomi.network.NetworkHelper]'s client, i.e. below
 * every Aniyomi/Mihon extension, because that client is the one they build on:
 * `AnimeHttpSource.network.client` and any `network.client.newBuilder()`
 * wrapper an extension adds (AnimeOnline.Ninja wraps it with its own
 * `VrfInterceptor`) all sit on top of this. The steps are the ones every
 * Mihon-family app takes, minus the dialog:
 *
 *  1. attach the cookies the shared WebView jar already holds for the host — a
 *     clearance the user earned with the globe button, or one an earlier solve
 *     earned — AND, when one of those cookies is a `cf_clearance`, present the
 *     request under the User-Agent that clearance was minted for. After that
 *     first solve, this alone is what makes the requests sail through;
 *  2. if the response is still a challenge, and another request for that host
 *     is not already solving it, load the page in an offscreen WebView
 *     ([CloudflareSolver], advertising the same UA) and retry ONCE with the
 *     cookie it earned;
 *  3. if that does not clear it either, record the host in
 *     [CloudflareVerifier] so the UI can offer the user's own verification
 *     (the globe button) instead of pretending the extension is broken.
 *
 * Images are deliberately NOT solved: a challenge on an image is a dead end
 * (the WebView loads documents, not pictures) and solving it would spend 20
 * seconds per cover. They get through on the clearance the document's solve
 * already stored in the jar — the same rule Nekoread's CloudflareInterceptor
 * uses.
