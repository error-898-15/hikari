/**
 * One display name per source: the source's own name, with a ` (n)` suffix on
 * every name that more than one source of the same extension carries.
 *
 * An Aniyomi extension is not one site — it can bundle a whole family of them
 * (`Jellyfin (1)…(3)` in the official index), and nothing stops two of them
 * from declaring the same `name`. Listed raw, those rows are indistinguishable:
 * nine sources called "AnimeWorld India" looked like the same extension
 * installed nine times. Suffixing only the colliding names (never a name that
 * is already unique) keeps every row honest and changes nothing for the
 * single-source extensions that make up most of the ecosystem.
 *
 * The suffix is the source's LANGUAGE whenever that tells the colliding sources
 * apart ("AnimeWorld India · Hindi" / "· English"), because that is what those
 * packs actually are — the same site published several times, once per audio
 * track — and a bare number says nothing about which one the user wants. A
 * language it already names in its own title is not repeated; when language does
 * not separate them, the site's host is used instead, and only then ` (n)`.

 * `tachiyomi.animeextension.class` (`;`-separated, a leading `.` meaning
 * "relative to my package"). Loading one is NOT an Android package install: the
 * APK is copied to `filesDir/aniyomi/exts/<pkg>.ext`, made read-only (Android
 * 14+ refuses to load a writable dex), inspected with
 * `PackageManager.getPackageArchiveInfo`, and finally its classes are
 * instantiated through a [ChildFirstPathClassLoader] whose parent is Hikari's
 * own class loader — so the extension links against the vendored
 * `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.*` API layer that ships in this app
 * (`app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/`), exactly the way the real Aniyomi
 * app does it.
 *
 * Each source of an extension becomes its own [ProviderType.ANIYOMI] provider
 * row (`aniyomi|<packageName>|<index>`), so one APK that bundles twelve sites
 * shows up as twelve sources, like it does in Aniyomi.
 *
 * Extensions are third-party code: every call into them can throw anything
 * (including `LinkageError`/`AbstractMethodError` from a source built against a
 * different extensions-lib), so loading is serialised per APK through
 * [LoadGate] and every failure becomes a short, human-readable [lastError] the
 * Extensions UI can show instead of an unexplained empty list.

     * ```

     * the index's directory: the APK from `<root>/apk/<apk>` and the icon from
     * `<root>/icon/<pkg>.png` — see Aniyomi's `NetworkLegacyAnimeExtension`.
     * [baseUrl] is the repo root ([indexDirFor] of the index URL); the first
     * source's `baseUrl` also gives the row a favicon without any network call.
     *
     * **Modern** (keiyoushi's `index.json`, the shape Mihon 0.20.1+ reads) —
     * the entries live under `extensionList.extensions` (see [indexEntries])
     * and carry ABSOLUTE URLs plus a string `versionCode`:
