 *
 * Encoding a pairing payload and decoding ONE camera frame are both here, and
 * nothing else: there is no still-image path (a screenshot of the code would
 * need a picker and a full-size bitmap decode) because the typed code is the
 * fallback every device already has.
 *
 * The code is written DARK-ON-LIGHT and rendered with a white margin, always,
 * whatever the app's theme is: a QR is read by a camera that knows nothing about
 * dark mode, and an inverted or dark-on-dark code simply does not scan. The
 * screen that shows one puts it on a white card for the same reason.
