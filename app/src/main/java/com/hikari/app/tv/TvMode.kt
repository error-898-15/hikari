/**
 * "Is this device a television?", asked once per launch and never guessed from
 * the model name.
 *
 * ONE APK serves phones, tablets, Fire TV, Android TV and Google TV. What
 * differs is not the app (the engines, the player, the downloads, the history
 * and the settings file are the same code) but the *chrome*: a phone has a
 * touchscreen and a taskbar, a television box has a remote and a 10-foot
 * viewing distance. This object answers which one we are running on, and every
 * TV-specific branch in the app reads its answer from here — see
 * [com.hikari.app.ui.navigation.AppRoot] for the rail, [TvFocusIndication] for
 * the focus ring every clickable gets on a TV, and the "TV & Remote" settings
 * folder for the user's own override.
 *
 * The signals, in order of trust:
 *
 *  - `UI_MODE_TYPE_TELEVISION` — the system saying so outright. Android TV and
 *    Google TV set it.
 *  - `android.software.leanback` — the Leanback (d-pad / 10-foot) feature.
 *    Android TV and Google TV declare it.
 *  - `amazon.hardware.fire_tv` — Amazon's own marker. Fire OS is not Google's
 *    TV build, so this is the one that catches a Fire TV Stick that reports a
 *    plain handheld UI mode (the older Sticks do).
 *  - `android.hardware.type.television` — the pre-Android-TV marker, kept for
 *    very old boxes.
 *  - NO touchscreen at all. Every television in existence lacks one, and a
 *    handful of cheap boxes declare none of the four features above. This is
 *    the signal that makes an unknown no-name Android box behave like a TV
 *    instead of like a phone with a taskbar you cannot tap.
 *
 * `android.hardware.type.pc` (ChromeOS and the desktop builds) is a hard NO:
 * those report no touchscreen either, and a Chromebook must not be handed the
 * living-room layout.
 *
 * Everything found here can be overridden by the user — some boxes genuinely
 * misreport themselves, and being stuck with an un-navigable layout because of
 * one wrong flag is not acceptable (Settings → TV & Remote → "This device is a
 * TV"). [override] is that choice, kept in the settings store and mirrored
 * here.
