/**
 * The D-pad plumbing every INTERACTIVE control needs on a television.
 *
 * Compose gives a phone user everything for free: a button is tapped where the
 * finger is, and a switch is dragged. A remote is different in three specific,
 * mechanical ways, and each one has cost this app a report:
 *
 *  1. **A toggle is not a target.** [androidx.compose.material3.Switch] is
 *     `toggleable`, so it *can* take focus — but it is a small target at the
 *     right-hand end of a full-width row, and Compose's two-dimensional focus
 *     search walks down the page from whatever was focused to the nearest
 *     candidate below it. Navigate down a settings page and the focus lands on
 *     (or skips straight past) the right-hand switches, so "when using the remote
 *     it never lands on the toggle option — it skips to the next one". [tvToggle]
 *     makes the switch answer the D-pad itself (centre/enter presses it,
 *     left/right flips it), so a toggle is usable from wherever the focus
 *     happens to be.
 *  2. **A slider is not a target either.** [androidx.compose.material3.Slider] is
 *     a wide, pointer-oriented control; with a remote there is no drag.
 *     [tvAdjust] gives it the D-pad: left/right step it by one of its own steps,
 *     through the same `onValueChange`/`onValueChangeFinished` pair a drag uses,
 *     so the setting is really saved and not merely redrawn.
 *  3. **A text field swallows the remote.** Once focus is in a text box the
 *     arrows move the CARET, and a caret that is already at the end of the line
 *     simply does not move: the focus stays in the box no matter which direction
 *     is pressed ("when the remote goes to a place where something has to be
 *     typed — a search bar, a repo URL — pressing the remote does not let go of
 *     the cursor or move anywhere else"). [tvTextFieldKeys] takes up/down out of
 *     the field's hands entirely (a single-line field has nothing to do with
 *     them) and hands them to the focus system, and does the same for left/right
 *     once the field is empty and the caret has nowhere to go.
 *
 * All three are made to work through the *preview* key pass, which runs from the
 * root down to the focused node — so a handler installed here always sees the
 * key before the component's own keyboard handling can consume it, and there is
 * no chance of a press being handled twice.
 *
 * Keys are read as Compose [Key]s (`event.key`, the platform-independent
 * mapping — see com.hikari.app.ui.screens.MangaReaderScreen, which has done
 * remote navigation this way since long before this file existed) rather than as
 * raw Android key codes: `Key.DirectionCenter` is the D-pad's select button on
 * every remote, whatever its `KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER` happens to be on the box.
 */

 *  select button arrives as [Key.DirectionCenter], an air-mouse or a keyboard as

 *
 * Applied to a `Switch`/`Checkbox`/`RadioButton`: the control is focusable (so a
 * D-pad can land on it at all), centre/enter presses it, and left/right flip it.
 * The press is consumed here so the component's own handler cannot apply it a

 * the caret; on an empty field there is nothing to move the caret over, so they
 * leave the box. Up and down never belong to a single-line field, so they are
 * taken unconditionally and handed to the focus system.
 *
 * Compose's own `moveFocus` is used rather than a hand-rolled "find the next
 * control", so the move follows exactly the same geometry the platform's own
 * D-pad handling does — including inside a scrolling list, which scrolls to
 * follow the new focus.
