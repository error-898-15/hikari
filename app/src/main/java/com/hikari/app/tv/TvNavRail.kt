/**
 * The television navigation rail: the left-hand strip of tabs that stands in
 * for the phone's bottom taskbar.
 *
 * A taskbar is a *touch* idea — it lives at the bottom edge, which is where a
 * thumb reaches, and it is hidden or smaller on most phones. A television has
 * neither a thumb nor a bottom edge that is easier to reach than the side: the
 * convention every streaming app on the platform follows is a vertical column
 * of destinations on the left, walked with Up/Down, with the content to the
 * right of it.
 *
 * It draws exactly the same [BottomTabs] list the phone's bar does, in the same
 * order, honouring the same "hide this tab" preference — so the two layouts
 * cannot drift apart, and a tab hidden on the phone is hidden here too.
 *
 * It is also where the D-pad *starts*: [AppRoot] does not request focus on any
 * page content, so the first arrow press after launch lands on the rail (the
 * selected tab), and Right walks into the page from there.
 *
 * EVERY TAB HAS TO BE REACHABLE, and that is not free. A television box reports
 * a very short screen in dp terms — a 1080p stick at density 2.0 is 540dp tall,
 * and one at density 2.4 is 450dp — while seven tab rows plus the wordmark want
 * ~600dp. The rail used to draw them anyway, centred in a plain Column, so the
 * first and last rows (Extensions, Settings) sat *off* the screen: a user could
 * not scroll down to them, because there was nothing to scroll and the remote
 * had nowhere to walk. The rows now share the height that actually exists (and
 * drop their labels when that leaves them too short to read), and the tab strip
 * is a lazy list, so a box that reports something even shorter still lets the
 * D-pad scroll the list to the focused tab instead of hiding it.
