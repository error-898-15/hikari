/**
 * The focus ring every clickable in the app wears on a television.
 *
 * On a phone, "what is under my finger" is answered by the finger — a ripple
 * under the touch. On a television there is no finger: the remote moves a
 * *focus* around the screen, and if nothing draws that focus the app is simply
 * unusable, because the user cannot see which button Enter is about to press.
 * Compose gives every clickable/toggleable/selectable component a focus state
 * already (that is what lets the D-pad walk the UI), and it hands the visual
 * feedback out through `LocalIndication` — the same seam the ripple uses. This
 * indication is installed there, once, in
 * [com.hikari.app.MainActivity]'s content: from then on *every* clickable in the
 * app — poster cards, settings rows, glass cards, dialog buttons, the rail —
 * draws a ring around itself when the remote lands on it, without a single call
 * site having to know that televisions exist.
 *
 * WHERE THE RING IS DRAWN IS THE WHOLE TRICK, and it was wrong before: the app's
 * cards are almost all `Modifier.clip(shape).background(...).clickable(...)`, so
 * the indication node sits INSIDE a clip. A ring drawn on the component's outer
 * edge — and worse, one scaled up to 1.06× so it "lifts" out of the row — is
 * therefore outside that clip and painted away entirely, which is exactly the
 * reported "the remote moves to another button but nothing shows where it is,
 * it is invisible". The ring is now drawn INSET from the component's own bounds
 * by rather more than half its stroke, and the content is not scaled at all, so
 * no clip anywhere in the app can remove it.
 *
 * Three things say "this is the focused one", because a television is watched
 * from four metres: the focused card is tinted with the accent colour, a soft
 * wide halo sits under the ring (which is what makes it survive busy poster
 * artwork), and a crisp ring is drawn on top. Pressing Enter brightens the tint,
 * so a press gives the same "give" a tap does.
 *
 * Installed whenever the app is in its television layout OR the last thing the
 * user touched was a remote/keyboard ([TvInput]) — a hub that reports itself as a
 * phone gets the ring the moment its remote is used — and never on a touch
 * device, where the ripple is exactly as it was.
