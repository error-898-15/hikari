/**
 * The same type scale with every style's family swapped for [family].
 *
 * This is how the app-wide font (Settings → Appearance & Theme → App font) reaches the
 * whole Compose UI: [com.hikari.app.ui.theme.HikariTheme] hands the result to
 * `MaterialTheme`, so every `MaterialTheme.typography.*` look-up — i.e. nearly
 * every Text in the app — already carries the user's choice. A null [family]
 * returns the stock scale untouched, which is what "System default" means.
 *
 * ALL fifteen styles are rebuilt, not only the seven this file customises:
 * a partially-constructed `Typography` leaves the styles it does not mention at
 * the Material defaults, and those use the platform font — a table header or a
 * snackbar would then keep the old face while everything around it changed.
