/**
 * The accent-colour preferences, mirrored into plain SharedPreferences so the
 * View-based screens (the player, mainly) can read them SYNCHRONOUSLY while an
 * Activity is being created — the same trick [UiScale] uses for the in-app UI
 * scale, and for the same reason: the player must build its pills/badges/time
 * bar with the right colours on the very first frame, not a DataStore round
 * trip later.
 *
 * The Compose side does not need this: it reads the DataStore flows, so a
 * change recolours the app instantly. MainActivity mirrors every emission here
 * (and the store setters do too, so the change is available immediately).
 *
 * [playerKey] resolves the "match app & player theme" switch: while it is ON the
 * player follows the app accent, so the two can never drift apart.
