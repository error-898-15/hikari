/**
 * How the "finding your server" card looks (Settings → App Layout → Loading
 * screen).
 *
 * The card is shown twice per play — the detail page puts it up on the tap and
 * the player continues with the same look until real video is on screen — so a
 * single choice covers both and the hand-off between them stays seamless.
 *
 *  - CINEMATIC — the original: the title's backdrop drifting slowly under a
 *                heavy scrim, the title breathing, a spinner at the bottom.
 *  - POSTER    — a glass card with the title's POSTER in it, so a portrait
 *                poster is never cropped; a hairline progress bar underneath.
 *  - SPOTLIGHT — no artwork at all: the accent colour blooms behind the title
 *                and a light sweeps across it. The most "designed" of the set.
 *  - MINIMAL   — flat background, small title, plain spinner, status line. For
 *                someone who wants to see that it is working and nothing else.
 *
 * The style is a pure presentation choice: every one of them carries the same
 * title, episode line and live status line (which the search keeps updating — a
 * server landing, "still searching the remaining extensions", a failure), so
 * nobody loses information by picking the quiet one.

/**
 * The treatment drawn OVER the loading card — Settings → App Layout → Loading
 * screen → Effect.
 *
 * The two quiet styles were reported as too plain ("minimal and spotlight is so
 * simple, it just shows the title zooming in and out"), so the loading cover now
 * has the same kind of signature details a poster card does: a band of light
 * sweeping across it, a breathing accent ring, a gallery mat around the frame,
 * or an accent bloom behind the name.
 *
 * Deliberately independent of the style: an effect is drawn over whichever card
 * the user chose, so "Minimal + gallery frame" and "Spotlight + sheen" are both
 * one setting each. Every effect is pure drawing on top of the existing cover —
 * no extra network request, no extra copy of the artwork — and they compose with
 * the styles' own motion rather than replacing it.
 *
 * The choice is a SET: more than one treatment can be on at once ("sheen and
 * aura ring", "gallery frame and sheen"), and each is drawn in its own layer so
 * the combination reads as one cover rather than two. An empty set is [NONE].
 *
 *  - [NONE]  nothing over the card (the styles as they were).
 *  - [SHEEN] a band of light sweeps across the cover, like a glossy print
 *            catching the light.
 *  - [AURA]  a breathing ring of light around the SCREEN's own edge, in its own
 *            colour (Settings → Aura ring colour).
 *  - [FRAME] a hairline gallery frame inset around the whole cover, just inside
 *            the aura ring when both are chosen.
 *  - [GLOW]  an accent bloom that swells and fades behind the title.
