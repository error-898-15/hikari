/**
 * Coil model helper. MRDS and 51CG encrypt their poster images (pic.xustgq.cn)
 * with a fixed AES key, so their plugins download+decrypt them into base64
 * `data:` URIs. Coil renders `ByteArray`/`File` models natively but a raw
 * data-URI string is opaque to it (and a ~1MB blob in the nav route crashes the
 * NavController). Decode once per URL and persist the bytes on disk (keyed by a
 * hash of the URI — the decryption is deterministic, so the same URI always
 * yields the same bytes), so the home catalog's posters are instant on the next
 * app open. Http(s) posters pass through untouched — Coil's own disk cache (see
 * HikariApp) covers those.
 *
 * Two hard-won invariants, both from posters coming back BLANK:
 *
 * 1. A poster is never thrown away. The item's URL is the only copy of the
 *    artwork — once [tokenize] replaces it with a token, a failed decode or a
 *    deleted file means that cell is blank *forever* (the feed would have to be
 *    re-fetched). So a payload that can't be decoded right now keeps its
 *    original URI, and [model] retries the decode off the main thread.
 * 2. Nothing heavy happens on the main thread. Decoding a full-size poster is a
 *    multi-MB allocation; doing that for a hundred cells inside composition is
 *    what made whole rows flicker out under memory pressure. [model] hands back
 *    null (the cell shows its placeholder icon) and queues the work; the
 *    per-poster state in [pending] then recomposes exactly the cell that asked
 *    for that poster.
