/**
 * The in-app lock (Settings → Privacy & Browsing → App lock).
 *
 * Wraps the whole app: while the lock is on and this session has not been
 * unlocked, nothing else is drawn — no screen and no dialog — and the unlock
 * card is all there is.
 *
 * When it locks again: the moment the APP leaves the foreground, which is
 * [ProcessLifecycleOwner]. Locking on the *activity* stopping would re-lock
 * every time the player opens, because the player is its own activity and this
 * one stops behind it — the user would come back from a film to a PIN prompt,
 * which is not what an app lock is for.
 *
 * The password is the required half: the fingerprint/face is only ever an
 * additional way in (see [AppLock]), so a device with no enrolled biometric
 * still opens with the password, and there is no recovery for a forgotten one —
 * the settings card says so before it is set.

/**
 * The unlock screen: the padlock, the dots, and a numeric keypad with the
 * fingerprint on its bottom-right — the shape every messenger's app lock has,
 * and the one the user asked for by sending a screenshot of it.
 *
 * The keypad is the front door, but it is not the only one: whatever was set as
 * the password may be a word rather than a PIN (the setting's own field is a
 * free text field), so "Enter password instead" swaps the keypad for a real
 * password field. Without it, an alphanumeric password would be unenterable.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS SCREEN HAS TO GET RIGHT, and all four were reported as bugs:
 *
 *  1. **As many dots as the password has.** The length is recorded when the
 *     password is set ([com.hikari.app.data.AppStore.appLockLenFlow]), so a
 *     4-digit PIN draws four dots and is submitted on the fourth digit. Showing
 *     a fixed six made a 4-digit PIN look like the app wanted six.
 *  2. **Never silent.** Verifying is deliberately expensive (120k PBKDF2
 *     rounds), so the check shows a spinner and the input is frozen while it
 *     runs. A screen that accepted a tap and did nothing for a second — and
 *     then, on failure, said nothing at all in text mode — is exactly the
 *     "clicking Unlock does nothing" report.
 *  3. **A wrong answer says so, in both modes**, shows the error on the field as
 *     well, and clears what was typed so the next attempt starts clean.
 *  4. **A way out.** A password that will not verify (a blob from an older build
 *     of this same app, a forgotten PIN) would otherwise leave the owner locked
 *     out of their own app forever. After a failed attempt the screen offers to
 *     turn the lock off, behind a confirmation that says plainly what that
 *     means: anyone holding the phone can then open Hikari.
