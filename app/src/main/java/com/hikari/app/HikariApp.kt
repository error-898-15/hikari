     * `Injekt.get<Application>().getSharedPreferences(...)`, and a source that
     * can't get its preferences throws before it can list anything. `Json`,
     * `NetworkHelper` and `JavaScriptEngine` are what `JsonExtensions.defaultJson`,
     * `AnimeHttpSource.network` and the JS-driven sources inject. `ProtoBuf` is
     * the odd one out: nothing in Hikari or in the extensions-lib API uses it,
     * but `keiyoushi.utils.ProtobufKt` — a helper library the yuzono/anime-repo
     * extensions bundle — reads it in a top-level property initialiser
     * (`val protoInstance: ProtoBuf = Injekt.get()`), so an extension linking
     * that library throws the moment anything touches the file.
     *
     * All of them are singletons so every installed extension shares Hikari's
     * one OkHttp stack (cookies + 5 MiB cache) instead of building its own.
     * Failures are logged by [ensureAniyomiInjekt]; an extension asking for
     * something still unregistered gets an `InjektionException` at its own call
     * site, which the provider turns into a per-source error message rather
     * than a crash.
