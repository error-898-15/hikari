     * A remote has no touch: it has Up/Down/Left/Right, OK and Back, plus the
     * transport buttons (play/pause, rewind, fast-forward). None of the phone
     * gestures exist there, so without this the app would be a video the viewer
     * could not pause, seek or leave. The model, which is the one every
     * streaming app on the platform uses:
     *
     *  - **Controls hidden (watching).** Left/Right seek 10 seconds each way and
     *    flash the same on-screen indicator a double-tap does (holding the
     *    button down repeats, so it scrubs — the remote sends repeats for a
     *    held key). Up/Down/OK bring the controls up instead of changing
     *    anything, so a stray press while watching never pauses the film.
     *  - **Controls visible (navigating).** Every direction key is handed to the
     *    controls themselves, which is what lets the D-pad walk the buttons:
     *    media3 gives its own control views focus, and intercepting Left/Right
     *    here as well would make the buttons beside the focused one unreachable.
     *  - **Play/pause, rewind and fast-forward** work at any time (a remote's
     *    transport buttons mean exactly what they say), and Back closes the
     *    controls first and only leaves the player on the second press.
     *
     * Only active on a television: on a phone this method does not run at all
     * (see the first line of [dispatchKeyEvent]), so not one key behaves
     * differently there.

     *
     * The sites are the part that works with nothing installed: an install of
     * CloudStream-style extensions and no subtitle addon used to be told "No
     * subtitle addon is installed" and had no way to get a subtitle at all, and
     * an install WITH one got "no subtitles found" for every title whose `tt` id
     * could not be resolved (see [com.hikari.app.subtitles.OpenSubtitlesSite]).
     * The sites answer by name, by id and in thirty-odd languages, and each one
     * is asked concurrently with its own timeout, so a site that is down costs
     * nothing but its own row going missing.
     *
     * This is also the manual half of what [startAddonSubtitleFetch] does on its
     * own, and it exists because the automatic pass has to be conservative: it
     * looks the title up by the name the item carries and takes whatever comes
     * back. A release the database does not know under that name, or an episode
     * of a show whose season numbering differs, comes back empty — and then
     * this, with the name typed the way the database has it, is what works. The
     * field opens pre-filled with the title, so the common case is one tap on
     * Search.

         * The pills scroll HORIZONTALLY inside the row when they do not all fit.
         * They used to be laid out at their natural width with nothing to scroll
         * them: on a phone in landscape the row is a few hundred dp wide, so a
         * row with four options ("Classic / Cinema / Boxed / Mono", or "None /
         * Outline / Shadow" plus its read-out) ran past the panel's edge, where
         * the panel's own clip cut the last pill in half — the reported "the
         * Custom button is going out of the curve, and the ones below it too,
         * and it won't scroll so I can't pick them". A row that scrolls can
         * always be reached, whatever the skin's width or the system font size.
         *
         * Two things about the shape, both learned from the language report
         * ("when I change the language the player box starts cutting"):
         *
         *  * the label is on its OWN LINE, so the scroller gets the panel's whole
         *    width and the label can wrap instead of being ellipsized into "Capt…"
         *    — the label no longer competes with the pills for the row.
         *  * the scroller is pinned to LTR even in a right-to-left language. Its
         *    content is a set of swatches and short toggles, and Android's
         *    HorizontalScrollView opens mirrored layouts scrolled to the far end,
         *    which shows the row's first pill sliced in half at the panel's edge
         *    — the exact "box is cut" artifact the user sent a screenshot of.

/**
 * Load-error handling tuned for aggregator CDNs — the reason a stream stalls or

 *
 * media3's [DefaultLoadErrorHandlingPolicy] retries everything it doesn't
 * explicitly exclude on a fixed 1 s → 5 s ladder and gives up after 3 tries.
 * That shape is wrong for these sources in both directions:
 *
 *  - a transient drop (one hung socket, a 502 from an overloaded edge, a
 *    connection reset mid-segment) gets only 3 retries — often not enough — so
 *    it surfaces as a fatal playback error: the player tears the stream down
 *    and fails over, even though re-requesting the same bytes on a fresh
 *    connection would have been seamless;
 *  - a genuinely dead link (expired signed URL answering 403/410, a 404)
 *    *also* burns those retries first, delaying the failover by seconds.
 *
 * So: terminal errors fail immediately (no delay at all), and transient ones
 * retry on a short 0.5 s → 2 s ladder for at most [MAX_RETRY_WINDOW_MS] of
 * wall-clock time, then escalate. Bounding by TIME rather than by attempt count
 * also fixes the worst case of an unreachable host: a 15 s connect timeout can
 * only be paid once inside that window instead of once per attempt.
 *
 * media3's variant/location fallback for adaptive (HLS/DASH) streams is left
 * intact — it is genuinely useful when one rendition of a master playlist is
 * broken while the others are fine.
