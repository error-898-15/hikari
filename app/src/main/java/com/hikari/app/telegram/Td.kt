/**
 * A real Telegram client, on TDLib — the library every official third-party
 * Telegram client is built on.
 *
 * This is what [TelegramWeb] cannot be: `t.me/s/<channel>` only ever shows what
 * an anonymous visitor sees, i.e. PUBLIC channels. Everything else — Saved
 * Messages, private channels and groups, chats with people, reading a chat's
 * history all the way back — needs an authorized MTProto session, and TDLib is
 * what speaks it (the API, MTProto, the crypto, the local database, the media
 * cache). The native library and the Java bindings it registers itself with
 * ship in `app/src/main/jniLibs` (libtdjni.so, one per processor) and
 * `org.drinkless.tdlib` — see the README.
 *
 * Signing in is the user's OWN Telegram account with the user's OWN api_id and
 * api_hash (my.telegram.org → API development tools). There is deliberately no
 * bundled pair: an api_id/api_hash belongs to the application that registered
 * it, and shipping someone else's — or one lifted out of another app's APK — is
 * both against Telegram's terms and something Telegram revokes. The tab asks
 * once and keeps them; after that the session lives in TDLib's own database and
 * survives restarts exactly like the real app's.
 *
 * Everything here FAILS SOFT: if the native library cannot load (an ABI we do
 * not ship, an install that stripped it), [available] stays false and the tab
 * says so — the public-channel browsing that needs no account keeps working.
