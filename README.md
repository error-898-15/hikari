# Hikari

**Hikari** (光) — a universal streaming app. One player, every ecosystem:

- **Stremio addons** — add any addon URL, browse catalogs, search, play.
- **Universal scrapers** — JSON-rule site scrapers, no code needed.
- **CloudStream .cs3 plugins** — Stage 2 ✅ — your existing `.cs3` extensions run unchanged.
- **SkyStream extensions** — Stage 3.

Modern Material 3 UI, HLS/DASH playback with per-source headers and subtitles, built in pure Kotlin + Compose.

## Support & community

Need help, found a bug, or want to request a feature? Join the **Hikari Telegram group** — the fastest way to reach me and get support:

- **Telegram:** <https://t.me/CodegeasseHikari>

Everyone is welcome — post your questions, bug reports, and feature requests there and I'll help you out.

### Reporting a bug — no screenshot needed

Hikari records its own logs on the device, so a report can carry the real error
text instead of a photo of the screen:

1. Open **Settings → Logs & diagnostics**.
2. Tap **Share all** (or Share on the one file you were asked for) and send it
   along with your message.

Two rolling app logs and one crash log are kept. A crash log holds the full stack
trace plus the last 300 log lines before the crash, which is usually enough to
identify the cause without reproducing it. Nothing is uploaded until you tap
Share or Save, and there is a **Clear all logs** button on the same page.

## Installing the app

The latest signed APK is on the **latest release** page:

- **Latest release:** <https://github.com/codegeasse1/hikari/releases/latest>

Download it on the phone and open it (allow "install unknown apps").

## Add extensions

### Official repos — add all sources in one tap

The quickest way to load sources is to add our two official extension repos. Each is a single URL that installs a whole collection of extensions.

**Hikari extensions repo** (native .hiki extensions)

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegeasse1/hikari-extensions/builds/repo.json
```

That URL is a `repo.json` listing every official extension (trimmed here):

```json
{
  "name": "Hikari Extensions",
  "description": "Official .hiki extensions for Hikari.",
  "plugins": [
    { "name": "Anime4i",  "url": "https://github.com/codegeasse1/hikari-extensions/releases/download/continuous/anime4i.hiki",  "version": 2, "tvTypes": ["series", "movie"] },
    { "name": "Anime",     "url": "https://github.com/codegeasse1/hikari-extensions/releases/download/continuous/anime.hiki",      "version": 1, "tvTypes": ["movie", "tv"] },
    { "name": "Castle TV", "url": "https://github.com/codegeasse1/hikari-extensions/releases/download/continuous/castle.hiki",   "version": 3, "tvTypes": ["movie", "tv"] },
    { "name": "Anikoto",   "url": "https://github.com/codegeasse1/hikari-extensions/releases/download/continuous/anikoto.hiki", "version": 3, "tvTypes": ["movie", "tv"] }
  ]
}
```

**Codegeasse CloudStream repo** (.cs3 plugins)

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegeasse1/codegeasse-cloudstream-repos/builds/repo.json
```

Its `repo.json` points at the plugin list:

```json
{"name": "Codegeasse Repo", "description": "Anime4i CloudStream extensions", "manifestVersion": 1, "pluginLists": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegeasse1/codegeasse-cloudstream-repos/builds/plugins.json"]}
```

#### Add the Hikari repo, step by step

1. Open **Hikari** and go to the **Extensions** tab (puzzle-piece icon at the bottom).
2. Tap **Add Hikari repo** (the top-left button with the puzzle-piece icon).
3. Paste this URL and tap **Add**:

   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegeasse1/hikari-extensions/builds/repo.json`

4. Tap the **Hikari Extensions** card that appears, then tap **Install** next to any extension you want (Anime4i, Anime, Castle TV, …).

#### Add the CloudStream repo, step by step

1. Open **Hikari** → **Extensions** tab.
2. Tap **Add CloudStream repo** (the top-left **+** button).
3. Paste this URL and tap **Add**:

   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegeasse1/codegeasse-cloudstream-repos/builds/repo.json`

4. Tap the **Codegeasse Repo** card, then **Install** the providers you want (Anime4i, Anikoto, Anineko, …).

> You can even paste a plain `github.com/owner/repo` link instead of the full raw URL — Hikari automatically finds the correct `repo.json`. Installed providers appear in **Home** and **Search** right away.

**Stremio addon:** Extensions → *Add Stremio addon* → paste the addon URL (it must serve `manifest.json`).

**Universal scraper:** Extensions → *Add scraper* → paste a JSON config. Two modes — **HTML mode** for classic sites with server-rendered pages, and **JSON-API mode** for single-page apps that only serve data through a JSON API.

### HTML mode — selector rules

```json
{
  "name": "MySite",
  "baseUrl": "https://example.com",
  "homeUrl": "/",
  "catalogs": [ { "id": "home", "name": "Home", "type": "movie" } ],
  "search": {
    "url": "/search?q={query}&page={page}",
    "item": ".result-item",
    "title": ".title",
    "href": "a@href",
    "poster": "img@src"
  },
  "detail": {
    "title": "h1",
    "poster": ".poster img@src",
    "overview": ".desc",
    "type": "series"
  },
  "episodes": {
    "url": "{href}",
    "item": ".episode",
    "number": "data-ep",
    "href": "a@href"
  },
  "streams": {
    "video": "video@src",
    "m3u8": "source[type*=m3u8]@src",
    "iframe": "iframe@src"
  }
}
```

Rules use CSS selectors; `element@attr` means read an attribute instead of text. `{query}`, `{page}`, `{href}` are substituted at runtime. Streams can be direct `video`/m3u8 or hidden inside an `iframe` (followed recursively).

### JSON-API mode — for SPA / API-only sites

Many modern streaming sites (JustAnime, etc.) are React/Vue single-page apps: their pages return an empty `<div id="root">`, so there is no HTML to scrape. Everything comes from a JSON API. For those, add an `"api"` block — the scraper talks to the API instead of parsing HTML. It sends the configured `headers` on every call (many APIs reject requests without the right `Origin`/`Referer`/`User-Agent`), and can route through the site's own proxy when the API is Cloudflare-gated.

```json
{
  "name": "JustAnime",
  "baseUrl": "https://justanime.to",
  "api": {
    "base": "https://core.justanime.to/api",
    "proxy": "https://neko.justanime.to/m3u8-proxy",
    "headers": {
      "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
      "Accept": "application/json, text/plain, */*",
      "Referer": "https://justanime.to/",
      "Origin": "https://justanime.to"
    },
    "catalogs": [
      { "id": "trending", "name": "Trending", "type": "series" },
      { "id": "popular", "name": "Popular", "type": "series" },
      { "id": "latestEpisode", "name": "Latest Episodes", "type": "series" },
      { "id": "airing", "name": "Airing Now", "type": "series" },
      { "id": "upcoming", "name": "Upcoming", "type": "series" },
      { "id": "favourite", "name": "Favourites", "type": "series" }
    ],
    "homePath": "/home",
    "searchPath": "/search",
    "searchResults": "results",
    "detailPath": "/anime/{id}",
    "detailData": "data",
    "episodesPath": "/anime/{id}/episodes",
    "episodesPageParam": "page",
    "episodesItems": "episodes",
    "episodesHasNext": "hasNextPage",
    "episodesMaxPages": 30,
    "episodeNumber": "number",
    "episodeName": "title",
    "streamsPath": "/watch/{id}/episode/{ep}/anineko/{lang}/hd1",
    "streamsLangs": "sub,dub",
    "streamsSources": "sources",
    "streamsUrl": "url",
    "streamsQuality": "quality",
    "streamsIsM3u8": "isM3U8",
    "streamsSubtitles": "subtitles",
    "streamsSubUrl": "url",
    "streamsSubLang": "lang",
    "streamsHeaders": "headers",
    "proxyStreams": true
  }
}
```

This is a working config — paste it into *Add scraper* and JustAnime appears in Home/Search.

#### `api` field reference

| field | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | — (required) | API root URL, e.g. `https://core.justanime.to/api`. |
| `proxy` | — | Optional URL that fetches the API on the site's behalf. The scraper tries `base` directly first, then falls back to `proxy?url=…&headers=…` (twice). Also used to wrap stream URLs when `proxyStreams` is on. |
| `headers` | — | HTTP headers sent with every API call — include `Origin`, `Referer`, `User-Agent`, `Accept`. |
| `catalogs` | — | Array of `{ id, name, type }` (`type`: `movie` or `series`) shown as Home rows. |
| `homePath` | `/home` | Endpoint that returns each home section as a keyed array; the catalog `id` is used as the array key. |
| `searchPath` | `/search` | Search endpoint. |
| `searchResults` | `results` | Response key holding the results array. |
| `searchQueryParam` / `searchPageParam` | `query` / `page` | Query and page parameter names. |
| `detailPath` | `/anime/{id}` | Detail endpoint (`{id}` = the item's numeric/string id). |
| `detailData` | — | Optional wrapper key the detail object sits under (e.g. `data`). |
| `episodesPath` | `/anime/{id}/episodes` | Paginated episode endpoint. |
| `episodesPageParam` | `page` | Page parameter name. |
| `episodesItems` | `episodes` | Response key holding the episode array. |
| `episodesHasNext` | `hasNextPage` | Boolean key that says "there's another page". |
| `episodesMaxPages` | `30` | Maximum pages to walk before giving up. |
| `episodeNumber` / `episodeName` | `number` / `title` | Episode fields for the number and name. |
| `streamsPath` | `/watch/{id}/episode/{ep}/anineko/{lang}/hd1` | Watch endpoint; placeholders `{id}`, `{ep}`, `{lang}`. |
| `streamsLangs` | `sub,dub` | Comma-separated language keys to try (each becomes a watch request). |
| `streamsSources` | `sources` | Response key holding the sources array. |
| `streamsUrl` / `streamsQuality` / `streamsIsM3u8` | `url` / `quality` / `isM3U8` | Fields on each source object. |
| `streamsSubtitles` | `subtitles` | Response key holding subtitles. |
| `streamsSubUrl` / `streamsSubLang` | `url` / `lang` | Subtitle fields. |
| `streamsHeaders` | `headers` | Key of an object of per-stream headers (e.g. `Referer`/`Origin`) the player must send to the CDN. |
| `proxyStreams` | `true` | Also emit each stream wrapped through `proxy` — for CDNs that only serve the site's own player. |

#### API-mode conventions

- List items carry `id`, `title` (either a string or `{ "english": …, "romaji": … }`), and a poster found from `cover` → `coverImage.extraLarge` → `bannerImage` (first hit wins).
- Detail responses use `format` (or `type`): `MOVIE` → movie, anything else → series. `description`, `genres`, `seasonYear`/`year` and `bannerImage` are picked up automatically.
- Episode ids are built as `{animeId}|{episodeNumber}` — used to fetch streams.
- Streams get the per-source `headers` attached (plus `User-Agent`), so hotlink-protected CDNs still play. Subtitles ride along on every source.

**CloudStream .cs3 plugins (repos):** Extensions → *Add plugin repo* → paste a CloudStream-style `repo.json` URL, e.g.:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegeasse1/codegeasse-cloudstream-repos/builds/repo.json
```

Hikari fetches the repo's `pluginLists`, shows every plugin (icon, description, author, version, checksum-verified install), and each gets a one-tap *Install* / *Uninstall*. Your saved repos persist across restarts.

You can also install a single `.cs3` directly: Extensions → *Install .cs3 from URL* (or *Pick .cs3 file*), e.g.:

```
https://github.com/codegeasse1/codegeasse-cloudstream-repos/raw/builds/JustAnimeProvider.cs3
```

The plugin's providers appear in Home/Search and play like any other source. One `.cs3` can register several providers (each gets its own card, toggle and delete). The plugin files are stored in the app's private `filesDir/cs3/`, so they survive app restarts.

## Roadmap

- **Stage 1 (done):** app core, Material 3 UI, Stremio addons, universal scrapers, Media3 player with headers + subtitles.
- **Stage 2 (done):** CloudStream `.cs3` plugin loader (native cloudstream3 API compatibility layer: MainAPI, models, factories, nicehttp `app`, M3u8Helper, loadExtractor, WebViewResolver, CloudflareKiller).
- **Stage 3 (in progress):** ✅ downloads (offline + export), ✅ favourites /
  continue-watching, ✅ new UI everywhere, ✅ customisable player controls /
  video-enhance presets / accent theming. Still to come: SkyStream shims,
  torrent engine (Stremio infoHash streams), Trakt.
